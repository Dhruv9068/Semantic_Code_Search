Thought for 4 seconds### Test Files for Semantic Code Search Engine

I'll provide you with a set of test files in different programming languages that you can use to test the Semantic Code Search Engine. These files contain various functions, classes, and algorithms that will help demonstrate the semantic search capabilities.

## How to Use These Test Files

1. Create a new directory for the test files:


```shellscript
mkdir test_repository
cd test_repository
```

2. Create each of the files below in this directory
3. Run the Semantic Code Search Engine
4. Index this test repository by entering the full path to your test_repository folder
5. Try searching for various concepts like "sorting algorithm", "file handling", "data structure", etc.


## Test Files

```typescriptreact project="semantic_code_search"
...
```

## Testing the Semantic Code Search Engine

Now that you have the test files, follow these steps to test the application:

### 1. Create the Test Repository

1. Create a new directory called `test_repository` on your system
2. Save all the provided files in this directory:

1. `sorting_algorithms.py`
2. `data_structures.py`
3. `file_operations.py`
4. `calculator.js`
5. `user_management.java`





### 2. Run the Semantic Code Search Engine

1. Make sure your Semantic Code Search Engine is running:

```shellscript
python app.py
```


2. Open your browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)


### 3. Index the Test Repository

1. In the "Index Repository" section, enter the full path to your test_repository folder

1. For example: `C:\Users\YourName\test_repository` or `/home/username/test_repository`



2. Click "Index Repository"
3. Wait for the indexing process to complete
4. You should see a success message and the statistics section should update


### 4. Test Searching

Try these search queries to test different aspects of the semantic search:

1. **Algorithm Searches**:

1. "sorting algorithm that uses divide and conquer"
2. "bubble sort implementation"
3. "algorithm with O(n log n) complexity"



2. **Data Structure Searches**:

1. "linked list implementation"
2. "binary search tree"
3. "stack data structure"



3. **File Operation Searches**:

1. "read json file"
2. "function to copy files"
3. "csv file handling"



4. **Language-Specific Searches**:

1. "javascript calculator"
2. "java user management"
3. "python data structures"



5. **Concept Searches**:

1. "authentication system"
2. "memory management"
3. "factorial calculation"





### 5. Evaluate Results

For each search:

1. Look at the relevance of the results
2. Check if the code snippets match what you were looking for
3. Note the similarity scores
4. See if the system correctly identified the programming language


### 6. Advanced Testing

1. **Try Complex Queries**:

1. "function that handles errors when reading files"
2. "data structure with O(1) insertion time"
3. "authentication with password hashing"



2. **Test Language Understanding**:

1. "find me code that sorts arrays"
2. "show me how to handle JSON data"
3. "I need to implement a user login system"





This test repository covers a wide range of programming concepts, algorithms, data structures, and languages, making it perfect for testing the semantic understanding capabilities of your code search engine.
