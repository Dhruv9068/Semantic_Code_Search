# Semantic Code Search Engine

A specialized search engine that understands Python code semantics, allowing developers to search for code by functionality rather than just keywords.

## Features

- Parse Python repositories to extract functions, classes, and their docstrings
- Generate semantic embeddings for code snippets
- Allow natural language queries to find relevant code
- Rank and return code snippets based on semantic similarity
- Provide a simple web interface for searching

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/semantic-code-search.git
cd semantic-code-search
